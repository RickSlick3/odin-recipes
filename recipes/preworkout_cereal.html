    <h1>Preworkout Cereal</h1>
    <p>This <em>gigantic</em> bowl of cereal will surely get your carbed up and full of energy. This is a meal suited for anyone who is getting ready to lift some heavy weights.</p>
    <p>This recipe is quick and easy, and will give you the proportionate macros for your workouts.</p>
    <p></p>Not satisfied, double the protein powder for more flavor (and PROTEIN) or add more cereal or banana to meet your macros</p>

    <h3>What You'll Need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ingredients</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>2.5 servings (100 grams) of Rise Krispies cereal</li>
            <li>1 scoop (~32 grams)of your favorite protein powder</li>
            <li>1 serving (~33 grams) of peanut butter</li>
            <li>1-2 bananas</li>
            <li>2.5 cups of your preferred milk (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Supplies</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>A shaker bottle</li>
            <li>A <strong>large</strong> bowl</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to follow:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Pour your cereal into the bowl</h4>
            <p>Maybe now you will see why the bowl needs to be large.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Add your banana(s) to the bowl</h4>
            <p>Slice the bananas into any sized chunks over the bowl for easy preperation. Peeled, of course.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Add your protein powder, peanut butter, and choice of liquid to the shaker bottle</h4>
            <p>This will allow the peanut butter flavor to be distributed evenly in the bowl.</p>
            <p>I like to use water for less calories and more plain flavor.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Shake your shaker bottle well and pour over the cereal</h4>
            <p>Shake for a minimum of 15 seconds. Pour and enjoy!</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
