    <h3>What You'll Need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ingredients</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound of pre-cut stir-fry beef</li>
            <li>1.5 cups of Minute Rice</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1-2 cups of stirfry veggies</li>
            <li>Stir-fry sauce of your choice</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Supplies</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>A medium sized pot with a lid</li>
            <li>A large pan/wok</li>
            <li>A spatula</li>
            <li>Non-stick cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to follow:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Dump your beef into the pan/wok and turn your stove burner to medium heat</h4>
            <p>The beef will need to cook for a while, so leave the stove on while you continue to work on the next steps.</p>
            <p>I recommend stirring the beed with the spatula between each next step.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Pour 1.5 cups of water into your medium sized pot and turn your stove burner to max heat</h4>
            <p>The water will boil quickly, so measure out your 1.5 cups of Minute Rice right after</p>
            <p>Once the water is boiling, pour the rice into the pot, cover, and remove from the hot burner.</p>
            <p>Don't forget to turn off the burner!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Add your 3 eggs and stirfry veggies</h4>
            <p>When the beef looses its raw color, add these ingreditents and stir around in the pan or wok</p>
            <p>Once the eggs look cooked and the veggies are soft, check to ensure the beef is cooked to a minimum of 140 degrees (farenheit).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Remove from the wok and enjoy!</h4>
            <p>Don't forget to add your favorite stir-fry sauce to the mix for extra flavor.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
