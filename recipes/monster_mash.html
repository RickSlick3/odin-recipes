    <h3>What You'll Need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ingredients</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound of pre-cut stir-fry beef</li>
            <li>1.5 cups of Minute Rice</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1-2 cups of stirfry veggies</li>
            <li>Stir-fry sauce of your choice</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Supplies</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>A medium pot with a lid</li>
            <li>A large pan/wok</li>
            <li>A spatula</li>
            <li>Non-stick cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to follow:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Dump your beef into the pan/wok and turn your stove burner to medium heat</h4>
            <p>The beef will need to cook for a while, so leave the stove on while you continue to work on the next steps.</p>
            <p>I recommend stirring the beed with the spatula between each next step.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>...Need to finish later...</h4>
            <p></p>
        </li>
    </ol>
